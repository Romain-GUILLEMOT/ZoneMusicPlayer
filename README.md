# ZoneMusicPlayer Plugin

‚ö†Ô∏è **Alert: Performance Warning** ‚ö†Ô∏è  
This plugin currently reacts to every player movement, which can lead to performance issues on large servers or with many players. To improve efficiency, the plugin should ideally trigger events only when a player **changes region or biome**, instead of checking on every movement. Future updates may address this limitation.

## ZoneMusicPlayer

- üåç **Biome Music**: Assign specific music to individual biomes.
- üå≥ **Biome Groups**: Group biomes together and assign shared music.
- üéß **Global Music**: Play default music when no other matches are found.
- üîß **Administrative Commands**: Reload the configuration, play sounds for players, or toggle debug mode.

2. Place the JAR file into your server's `plugins` folder.

## How It Works

1. **Region Detection**:
    - Music is prioritized if the player is in a specific region.

2. **Biome and Biome Group Detection**:
    - If no region music exists, the plugin checks for music assigned to the player's biome or biome group.

3. **Global Fallback**:
    - If no region, biome, or group music is found, a global track is played.

4. **Debug Mode**:
    - Provides detailed messages about which context and music are being used for testing and troubleshooting.

## Known Issues

‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance Warning**
- The plugin currently reacts to every player movement (`PlayerMoveEvent`). This can impact server performance, especially on servers with many players.
- **Improvement Suggestion**: Create events to detect when a player **changes region** or **enters a new biome** instead of reacting to every block movement.
